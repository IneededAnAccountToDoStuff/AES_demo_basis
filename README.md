# AES_demo_basis
A simple AES calculator

This was not put together intelligently. It was a project started years ago, abandoned, and pulled out of the grave.

Thanks to @J-Faustus (speed competition) , I dug it out and improved it. He has his own [implementation](https://github.com/J-Faustus/Python-AES).

Due to its weird history, it has a number of unexplained stuff. Like that weird `_mult` table.

It's currently missing other modes, but I will.
